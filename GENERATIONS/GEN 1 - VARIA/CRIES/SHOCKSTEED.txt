The cry starts with a soft, low-pitched whinny, reminiscent of a horse's neigh, but with an electric crackle layered over it. The crackle gradually builds up, becoming more intense and electric, as if the stored electricity in Shocksteed's body is being released in bursts. The cry ends with a sharp, high-pitched buzz, resembling the sound of a bug zapper or an electrical discharge, echoing slightly as if it's reverberating through the woodland where Shocksteed hides.
