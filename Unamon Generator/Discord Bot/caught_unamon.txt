Its fur is a vibrant mix of bright purple and deep blue, with a pattern of jagged lines that seem to shimmer and shift like the colors of a rainbow.\n\nIts most distinctive feature is its large, curved horns, which twist and spiral in unpredictable ways. These horns are a symbol of its connection to Discord, and they can emit powerful bursts of energy that can disrupt the environment around it.\n\nDespite its chaotic nature, Zagazeal is a social creature that thrives in groups. It communicates with other Zagazeal using a series of high-pitched chirps and calls, which can be quite jarring to those who are not accustomed to them.\n\nIn battle, Zagazeal is a force to be reckoned with. It is a dual-type Normal/Electric Unamon, which gives it a wide range of abilities and attacks. It is particularly adept at using moves that disrupt the opponent's movements and weaken their defenses.\n\nOverall, Zagazeal is a fascinating and unique Unamon that embodies the unpredictable and chaotic nature of Discord while also drawing inspiration from the grace and beauty of the gazelle.", "stats": "Signature Move: Discordant Horns - A powerful physical attack where Zagazeal charges towards the opponent, ramming them with its twisted horns. This move has 90% accuracy, 100 base power, and a PP of 10. It is an Electric-type move and has a secondary effect of causing the opponent to become confused.\n\nCategory: The Discordant Gazelle Unamon\n\nHeight/Weight: Zagazeal stands at 4'6\" and weighs 77 lbs.\n\nStats:\n- HP: 75\n- ATK: 105\n- DEF: 65\n- SpA: 85\n- SpD: 70\n- Speed: 120\n\nEvolves from: Zagazeal does not evolve into or from any other Unamon.\n\nPok\u00e9dex Entry: Zagazeal's horns are said to be imbued with the power of Discord itself. Its movements are unpredictable and erratic, making it difficult to predict its next move. Despite its chaotic nature, it is a social creature that thrives in groups. Its vibrant fur and graceful movements make it a sight to behold in the wild.\n\nAbilities:\n1. Static - A classic Electric-type ability that has a 30% chance of paralyzing the opponent when hit with a physical attack.\n2. Serene Grace - A Normal-type ability that doubles the chance of secondary effects occurring when using moves.\n3. Disruptive Presence (Hidden Ability) - Opponents who switch in while Zagazeal is on the field have their accuracy lowered by 20%, reflecting the disruptive energy that surrounds this Unamon.\n\nNote: The ability Disruptive Presence can only be obtained through breeding with a parent that already has this ability.\n\nOverall, Zagazeal is a unique and powerful Unamon that combines the grace and beauty of the gazelle with the unpredictable and chaotic nature of Discord. Its signature move, Discordant Horns, is a formidable attack that can confuse opponents while dealing significant damage. With its high speed and impressive attacking stats, Zagazeal is a force to be reckoned with in battle.", "picture": "https://i.imgur.com/k8xWc3A.jpg"}, {"name": "Smoglet", "description": "Smoglet is a bipedal, chiropteran Unamon with a primarily brown body and orange eyes. It has long, pointed ears from either side of its head that emit heat, which illuminates this Unamon's path and its body, giving it a short orange-hue. The ears are only warm to the touch and seem to move depending on Smoglet's emotions (down when sad, up when angry, back when scared).\n\nGiven it's small size and weight, Smoglet protects itself with its wings, which despite being fragile too, regenerate whenever damaged, though never fully. Smoglet cannot use its wings to fly due to this. They also have two small fangs at the top of its mouth and a red patch of fur right below their neck.", "stats": "**Types**: Fire and Ghost\n\n**Height**: 0.5m\n**Weight**: 1.0kg\n\n**LEARN CF. 5#** - These Unamon never produced heat by themselves before and would hunt for leaves and other materials to warm themselves up in their caves. However, a large group of these tiny creatures became stuck in a cave that had been damaged enough to cause a cave in. Because of this, the Smoglet learnt to produce heat in its ears to survive this traumatic event. Only after being rescued and taken by to the Nursery, did the D.U.S.T scientists realise that they had Smoglets that emitted heat and others that didn't. The ones that don't have glowing ears are now rare to find, either having died in the cold or worse.\n\n**LEARN CF. 11#** - Smoglet will use its big eyes to demand food, attention and even to trick others. Their big eyes will turn soft and almost sparkling, which gives them an innocent appearance even if they're slightly mischievous Unamon.\n\n**LEARN CF. 18#** - Smoglet leave a trail of ash and dust behind them, bigger Smoglet's will leave more dust, while smaller ones will leave less. It is unclear where this ash comes from, though it's theorised to be from their regenerative wings considering those with more damaged wings will leave more ash.", "picture": "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/welcometouna/images/f/f2/Smoglet.png"}, {"name": "Flamura", "description": "Flamura is a chiropteran Unamon with reddish-brown short fur, and two flaming wings that are bigger than its entire body. Though the outside of its wings are extremely hot, the inside is warm, yellow and fleshy. Flamura also has hair that resemble its wings, less hot however, but still bothersome considering it's long enough to obscure Flamura's vision. The flames in its wings and hair release ambers like normal fire. Considering its ears are much shorter too, it seems Flamura's senses have lessened, which makes them particularly clumsy creatures.\n\nThey have a red \"coat\" that goes through all of their backside until it reaches their tail, which is a thin average sized limb that ends in a sharp pointy end, though it is usually blunted. It also seems to almost glow slightly at its tip, similar to their wings. Besides that, their eyes remain an orange colour, though slightly more reddish. They also seem to have dark circles underneath their eyes, perhaps due to their ghost lineage (even though it is absent in the DNA), and continue to bare a red square below their neck, although multiplied, making it seem like a small bow. They have two short stubby legs with dark red claws, they only use these to grip and land, never to hurt.", "stats": "**Types**: Fire and Ghost\n\n**Height**: 0.9m\n**Weight**: 4.0kg\n\n**LEARN CF. 22#** - They are known for causing fires and burning buildings/objects, though not on purpose. Flamura is a very playful and friendly creature, often making friends with humans who encounter it. They are just extremely clumsy.\n\n**LEARN CF. 23#** - Flamura are one of the friendliest and diplomatic Unamon researched. They appear to dislike conflict and even attempt to deescalate situations that may lead to violence, however, this has reached extreme measures where they will protect an Unamon despite getting hurt over it. Flamura are known for their selfless nature.\n\n**LEARN CF. 25#** - Perhaps from its previous evolution, Flamura like to wrap their tail around their body when nervous or scared, much like Smoglet does with its wings.\n\n**LEARN CF 29#** - It is only observed sometimes, but some of them will appear invisible in the dark, with only their glowing wings visible. It is odd considering in the dark, most of their body appears visible due to the light coming from many points in its body. However, when this invisible tactic happens, it's like the light from their wings is an illusion, as it doesn't illuminate anything. This has only happened to particularly unfriendly Flamura who don't wish to engage with others, as you can tell, that is quite rare for Flamura.", "picture": "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/welcometouna/images/1/16/Flamura.png"}], "386145081092079623": [{"name": "Mutamania", "description": "Mutamania is a ghostly, quadrupedal Unamon that appears to be made up of various mismatched body parts. Its body is primarily white matted fur, with a sickly yellow look to it. It has patches of different colours and textures scattered throughout. Mutamania seems to have originated or have been a mouse initially, but after melding with other limbs or characteristics of other Unamon, some no longer look like mice anymore.\n\nThe body parts taken from other Unamon are still unknown as to how they are ingrained into Mutamania. The most scientific answer is that Mutamania simply grew them after altering itself upon meeting a creature it wanted to replicate. This is the most likely since Ghost Unamon don't contain DNA and are instead manifestations, free to alter themselves without obeying biology (albeit Mutamania contains a small percentage of DNA that remains unaltered). Although, the popular theory is that it massacres other Unamon and stitches its body parts onto its body by itself. That theory has yet to be disproved.\n\nEither way, no Mutamania is the same, but one thing they all seem to share is the antlers that resemble tree branches on top of its head (varying in colours) and its red-like beady eyes of mismatched shades and sizes. Most of its kind will also have cracks and scars across its body. Some of them seem like they were stitched up, while the cracks are usually on its face or head, resembling a hard surface being broken. This is particularly interesting when the cracks spread, causing their faces to seem almost unrecognisable. The cracks usually indicate a Mutamania's age.", "stats": "**Types**: Normal and Ghost\n\n**Height**: 1.5m\n**Weight**: 40.1kg\n\n**LEARN CF. 64#** - Mutamania suffers severely from psychotic behaviour, which consists of self-mutilation, anger outbursts, and sometimes (if intense) heart failure. They are usually caused by self-reflection, since Mutamania no longer knows what or who it is.\n\n**LEARN CF. 65#** - Mutamania's ability to shift body parts and/or change the way it looks has never been observed, but it's said it does it very quickly, almost in a blink of an eye. This has been particularly useful to escape a predator.\n\n**LEARN CF. 66#** - Mutamania's teeth fall out regularly, but they grow just as fast too. It's unknown why this happens.\n\n**LEARN CF. 68#** - Although it seems aggressive and hostile, Mutamania rarely cause harm to other Unamon by choice, preferring to run away and hide if need be. This however, doesn't mean they are weak, considering when they do fight for survival, they lack the awareness to keep themselves unharmed and often cause tremendous amount of damage to the victim and themselves.\n\n**LEARN CF. 70#** - Mutamania gets attached very easily to people. If they start to like someone, they will follow them everywhere and constantly ask for validation from them. Although they very easily move on to other people too.\n\n**LEARN CF. 72#** - Their origins have been studied extensively, and many believe they are by-products of a human experiment, rather than natural selection. This is reinforced by the fact that they do carry some small dose of DNA from an unidentified creature. But nothing is yet confirmed.\n\n**LEARN CF. 77#** - Mutamania don't die of natural causes (such as old age) and they cannot breed. This makes them at high risk for extinction.", "picture": "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/welcometouna/images/e/ea/Mutamania.png"}]}
